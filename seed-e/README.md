## üîß API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/2fa/generate` - 2FA setup
- `POST /api/auth/2fa/verify` - 2FA verification
- `POST /api/auth/generate-recovery-key` - Recovery key generation

### Provider Management

- `GET /api/providers/policies` - List provider services
- `POST /api/providers/policies` - Create new service
- `GET /api/providers/signature-requests` - List pending requests
- `POST /api/providers/signature-requests` - Submit signed PSBT

### Client Services

- `GET /api/services` - List available services
- `POST /api/services/purchase` - Purchase a service
- `GET /api/clients/purchased-services` - List client's purchased services

### Test Data Generation

- `GET /api/generate-test-data` - Generate fresh Bitcoin keys and signatures

> **üö® Production Requirement**: Current implementation uses mock Lightning invoices with "pending payment" status. For production, Lightning payments must be atomic - either payment succeeds and key is immediately purchased, or payment fails and key remains available. No "pending payment" state should exist in production.

## üîí **Critical Security Information**

### **Hashed xpub Storage**

**No database contains plain text xpubs.** All extended public keys are hashed using HMAC-SHA256 with a server secret before storage. Even if the database is compromised, the actual xpubs remain secure. Only hashed values are stored and transmitted.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Ecosystem Limitation**: The hashed xpub system only prevents key reuse **within our platform's ecosystem**. Providers could still use the same xpub in other services outside our platform. Clients must trust that providers are not reusing keys elsewhere. We can only enforce good key management within our ecosystem - the broader Bitcoin ecosystem requires trust and reputation.

### **Master Key Requirements**

**This platform is NOT for users who cannot handle basic key backup.** Both clients and providers must securely backup their master keys. If you cannot properly backup a simple master key, you are in the wrong business and should use an ETF or custodial backup service instead.

**Requirements:**

- **Providers**: Must securely store their signing keys and master keys
- **Clients**: Must backup their master keys for assisted wallet recovery, to prove they bought this service from the provider
- **No Custodial Service**: This is a non-custodial platform - you control your keys
- **Self-Service**: Users are responsible for their own key management, there is no customer support

**If you cannot meet these basic requirements, this platform is not for you. You may be better suited for fiat or custodial solutions**

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Docker
- **Bitcoin**: bitcoinjs-lib, bip32, tiny-secp256k1
- **Authentication**: TOTP 2FA with speakeasy
- **Payments**: Lightning Network (BOLT12)
- **Security**: HMAC-SHA256 hashing for xpub storage

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5433/seed-e-db"

# Security (REQUIRED - Keep this private and unique to your deployment)
XPUB_HASH_SECRET="your-strong-secret-key-here"

# Optional: Production database
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="your-production-database-url"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="your-production-direct-url"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Notes:**

- The `XPUB_HASH_SECRET` is required for secure xpub hashing
- **Keep this secret private and unique to your deployment**
- **Never commit this to version control**
- **Don't share this secret between different deployments**
- **Once set, don't change it** - changing it will break verification of existing hashed xpubs - I can not overstate how detrimental this will be to your clients and providers.
- Each deployment should have its own unique secret for maximum security isolation

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd seed-e
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and API keys
   # REQUIRED: XPUB_HASH_SECRET for secure xpub hashing
   ```

4. **Start the database**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

6. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Client Registration**: Test user registration and validation
2. **Service Purchase**: Test the complete purchase flow
3. **Provider Dashboard**: Test service creation and management
4. **Security**: Verify xpub hashing and purchase tracking

### API Testing

Test the core APIs:

```bash
# Test services API
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/services

# Test purchase API (replace with actual IDs)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/services/purchase \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"serviceId":"service-id","clientId":"client-id"}'
```

### Security Testing

- Verify xpubs are hashed in database
- Test purchase tracking prevents duplicate purchases
- Verify purchased services disappear from marketplace

## üöÄ Deployment

### Development

docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="your-db-url" \
  -e XPUB_HASH_SECRET="your-secret" \
  seed-e
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Verify environment variables are set

**Database Issues**

- Check PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Reset database if needed: `npx prisma db push --force-reset`
- Verify DATABASE_URL in .env

**Purchase Issues**

- Check user is logged in and userId is stored
- Verify service exists and is not already purchased
- Check browser console for debugging messages

**Security Issues**

- Ensure XPUB_HASH_SECRET is set
- Verify xpubs are hashed in database
- Check purchase tracking is working

### Debugging

**Check Server Status**

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl -I http://localhost:3000

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep "next dev"
```

**Database Debugging**

```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma db pull

# View database schema
npx prisma studio
```

**API Debugging**

```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/services
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/clients/purchased-services?clientId=test
```
